Arr.h and LL.h are dynamic array and linked list implementations from offline 1.

Stack.h -> stack implementation. reused code from offline 1
Queue.h -> queue implementation. reused code from offline 1
		
SQ_main.cpp -> demonstarted stake and queue funtionalities
		to use Arr implementation comment out #include"LL.h" and #include"Arr.h" to use LL implementation

input.txt and output.txt -> input and output file for SQ_main.cpp

task2_main.cpp -> cpp file for task 2. understood the problem but could not able to write  the code.
			idea :
				1. stored the informations in MyList using a customer class
				2. 1st customer goes into pc1
				3. then the customer goes into line1 to use pc1 until the queue is of size 3
				4. if the queue is full then pc2 is available to use , and line2 is a stack
